It is with great pleasure that I am applying for the open position of a Contract Manager in your Legal and Contract management team.
I am interested in the open position due to my experience in the metal industry and International
business contracts. Also, Outotec as a global leader in a mineral and metals processing and developer
of many breakthrough technologies in metals and mining industry, interests me as potential employer. I
believe that my good overview of the metal industry together with my experience with contracts and
educational background provide good prerequisites for succeeding in the position of Contact Manager.


I have graduated from Satakunta University of Applied Sciences International Business with focus on
Cross-Cultural Business Relations. My studies allowed to immediately start working in the international import/export sector
of commodities. In the following ten years my carreer has consisted of proficuous experiences in different companies, in each of which
I was able to both improve my skills, professionally and personally, as well as to contribute to the success of the company. Even though
each step meant to abandon a position I was competent in to start a new experience somwhere else, I found each of such steps to be a fundamental
one in my professional growth, as it forced me each time to expand my knowledge and to learn new aspects of the business, as well as to
explore new markets. The last big step was to join NEOT in 2012 where for 4+ years I worked as an Logistics
and Operations Coordinator, before being promoted to the position of Contract Manager and Demurrage Specialist, where I have been required
to negotiate on a daily basis contract terms and conditions as well as to take care of the demurrage claims. Even though my time at NEOT has 
been extremely satisfying, I've realized that the opportunities for learning within the oil trade are now limited for me


My degree in International business provides me with expertise in
International trades in the whole supply chain and foreign trade documentation. In my specialized
professional studies I concentrated on movement of goods, international marketing, cultural studies and
global project management.

In November 2016, I moved to my previous position as a Contract
Manager and demurrage specialist. My current task on contract side include issuing spot and term
contracts, checking the purchase contracts, negotiating contract terms and conditions, and of course
making sure that we are minimizing risks and maximizing operational performance. My task on
demurrage side is to negotiate demurrage claims daily. I work in close collaboration with the trading
desk, operations, risk management, sustainability, finance and shipping department.

I received good feedback for my precise way of working, from my supervisor and from my other
colleagues.

I would be pleased to discuss my job application further in a personal interview.
